Our absolute beginner tutorial will turn you from <strong>wannabe</strong> to webmaster in just a few hours. Unlike many other HTML tutorials, it's a step-by-step guide – not a boring long-winded reference.

Our step-by-step guide teaches you the basics of HTML and how to build your first website. That means how to layout an HTML page, how to add text and images, how to add headings and text formatting, and how to use tables.
While many guides on the internet attempt to teach <strong>HTML</strong> using a lot of mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will instead focus on giving you the practical skills to build your first site.

The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/"target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">first web page without spending</a> the entire tutorial focusing too much on the “why.”

By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic website and we hope that this will inspire you to delve further into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.
TML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

<u>Hypertext</u> means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.

A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
